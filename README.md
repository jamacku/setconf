setconf
=========

Setconf is a small utility for changing settings in configuration textfiles.

Patches are welcome.


Requirements
------------
* Only Python
* Alternatively, it can be compiled to native with <a href="http://nuitka.net/">nuitka</a>. These parameters should work: `--exe --lto --python-version=3.3`
* One of the tests fails with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/shedskin">shedskin</a> (and shedskin does not support mkstemp), otherwise that would be a possiblity too.


TODO
----
* A way to change only the n'th occurence of a configuration option
* Add support for changing values of "#define" and "(setq" as well?
* Manipulate bytes, not strings or lines.
* Rewrite in Go?
* An option for removing the configuration value instead of using ''.
* Optimize the code that is used for adding options with -a.
* An option for removing both the key and the value.
* Test and fix the combination of -a and multiline markers.
